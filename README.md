Hello Everyone! **`Pentagram2021`** is a group of humbeled engineers whose passion is to build a better, reliable and affordable software with sound guiding architectural principles, style and design.

The name Pentagram is the shape of a five-pointed star polygon and we as a member of 5 engineers, its no brainer that we picked this name. We are excited and thrilled to share our solution with the team.

Its the fastest friendship we have ever made, just a week ago we did not know each others and now we are 100% into this project. Just five passionate guys about software architecture.
